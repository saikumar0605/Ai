Flight Delay Model using Dask This is a project to build a machine learning model to predict flight delays using Dask, a parallel computing library for Python. The model is built using a dataset of flight information, which includes features such as flight date, airline, departure and arrival times, and distance. The goal is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed by 15 minutes or more, based on these features.",
